## Reddit bot
You can use this bot to automatically upload transcriptions to your Subreddit's wiki. It uses the Reddit library [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html). One thing to note is that you'll have to set up app credentials (there are good directions in the quickstart link above). You can either chose to have the bot run through your personal account or through it's own dummy account. Whichever account it uses is, practically speaking, not going to be able to use TFA. If you really, really want to use a TFA enabled account, let me know and I can add that capability later (or you can [just update your .ini file every time you use the program.](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html#two-factor-authentication))
